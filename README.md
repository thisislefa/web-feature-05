# Physics-Based Interactive Card Stack

A sophisticated interactive card system that simulates realistic physics for dragging, throwing, and flipping interactions. Built with vanilla JavaScript and GSAP for high-performance animations, this component provides an engaging user experience with organic motion and intuitive interactions.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics Engine**: Implements velocity-based throwing with friction, bounce, and spring mechanics
- **Dual-Sided Cards**: Interactive flip animation with both front and back content
- **Multi-Input Support**: Comprehensive mouse and touch interaction handling
- **Organic Motion**: Randomized physics parameters create natural, non-mechanical movement
- **Boundary Collision Detection**: Cards bounce realistically off screen edges with energy conservation
- **Haptic Feedback**: Optional vibration support for mobile devices
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses GSAP animation library and will-change properties for smooth 60fps
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with proper touch targets
